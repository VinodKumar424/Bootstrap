            All of us, who use cell phones, computers, or similar devices with internet access, 
            will face some annoying virus on our devices. Whether it’s because of us constantly 
            opening advertisements on the desktop or because of it that our information is really compromised. 
            table places for something like this are cafes, as they usually use Wifi, which is almost 70% of 
            the work done for hackers. Let’s see how not to get caught in the clutches of a hacker while working 
            in a cafe and homegrounds.

            Pare-feu is a kind of filter that regulates the input and output and blocks certain connections
             of your computer. In order for a hacker to hack into your computer, he must bypass Pare-feu, 
             that is, to find an error and free passage. These errors and uncontrolled free passes are regularly 
             corrected with the Pare-feu update. Therefore, they should be regularly accepted and worked on, 
             no matter how long they lasted. If the virus does get past Pare-feu, there is an antivirus program 
             that should be effective enough to block the virus. 
            Experience says antiviruses that are sold are much more effective than non-paid ones.

                There are various wifi keys. The WEP key is most widespread as it is the first choice on 
                most computer equipment. Unfortunately, it is also the worst choice. A good hacker is able 
                to break the WEP key in 3 to 5 minutes, while you are drinking coffee on the terrace of a coffee
                 shop and you are connected to some free wifi network, while consulting your e-mails, a few meters
                  away is a hacker, able to break into your smartphone or portable computer.
                 Instead, it takes as long as 11 to 16 hours to crack a WPA 2 hacker key.
