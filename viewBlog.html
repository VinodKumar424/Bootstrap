            It’s difficult to motivate yourself to always be a hard working man.
             But it is through hard work that you can achieve career advancement or any of your other dreams.
             So how do you motivate yourself to work hard even on days you don’t feel like it?

            Setting your sights on a huge goal can be intimidating and might lead you to procrastinate.
             Divide your work into small, achievable goals. Working on small goals will make you feel more 
             confident as you tick things off your list little by little. This way, you’d be making progress
              without realizing 
            it and each progress will motivate you to work on the next step.

                The people you spend a lot of time with can impact how you behave. No man is an island, as they say, 
                and it’s important to surround yourself with people who share the same ideals as you.
                 If you surround yourself with hard-working people, you’ll be more motivated to work hard yourself.
                 Ever heard the saying “the mind is willing but the flesh is weak?” 
                 Your mind might be working on overdrive, but your body might not be able to keep up. 
                 Make sure you’re also taking care of yourself physically so you can achieve 
                 your day to day goals without any illnesses to stop you.
                  Workout regularly! Most successful people make it a habit to exercise.
                  Work can get so demanding that it's difficult to achieve a proper work-life balance. 
                  You could be working for a demanding boss who calls you even during unreasonable hours or
                 during a holiday or perhaps you are working on your startup and forgot to rest.
                 Whatever it is, it's always important to make sure you keep your lifestyle in check to avoid burnout. 
                 Technology has made tons of work and communication easier for us, but unfortunately, it also created
                  the expectation that we are always reachable 24/7. Give yourself some time off by unplugging from 
                  your devices especially during family and personal time. There’s no need to 
                 rush answering emails just because you can easily access them, especially not after office hours.
                          
            </p>
